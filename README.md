# Vicon Data Export
Vicon data exporting and processing

The code in this repository was written by Kirsty McDonald from the University of New South Wales, and updated for my own usage. Please acknowledge the original author if using this code.

## To Use
1. Open a data collection file in Vicon Nexus
2. Open Matlab and run the script

Matlab will connect to Vicon Nexus using the first line of the script. The data exported will correspond to the session you opened in Vicon Nexus.
